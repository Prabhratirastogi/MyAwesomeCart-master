      <p>My Awesome Cart (Mac) Pvt Ltd. is an Indian electronic commerce company based in Lucknow, India. Founded by Prabhrati Rastogi and Akansha yadav in 2022, the company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Amazon' s Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] as of March , Mac held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Mac is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] Mac also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

In August 2022, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Mac for US$16 billion, valuing it at $22 billion. It allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.It’s tough to imagine daily life without e-commerce. We order food, clothes, and furniture; we register for classes and other online services; we download books, music, and movies; and so much more. E-commerce has taken root and is here to stay. This site offers a vast category of daily needs to fashion accessory with multiple brands and companies. The categorization of products provide smooth user experience and a cake walk searching. </p>
